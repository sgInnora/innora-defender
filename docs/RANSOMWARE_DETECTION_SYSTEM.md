2. **Automatic Variant Detection**
   - Feature extraction and similarity matching for new variants
   - Cluster-based analysis for variant identification
   - Automatic family definition generation
   - Distinctive feature analysis for variant characterization

3. **Real-time Monitoring and Integration**
   - Continuous sample processing and analysis
   - Automatic alerts for new variants
   - Integration with tracking systems (JIRA, Slack, MISP)
   - API for integration with other systems

4. **Relationship Visualization**
   - Interactive graph visualization of family relationships
   - Similarity analysis between variants
   - Feature-based relationship detection
   - D3.js-based web visualization

## Usage

### Family Detection

```bash
# Identify ransomware family
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.cli identify --sample /path/to/sample.json

# List available families
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.cli list

# Show family details
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.cli show --family lockbit
```

### Variant Detection

```bash
# Process a sample for variant detection
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.variant_cli process --sample /path/to/sample.json

# Process a batch of samples
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.variant_cli batch --samples-dir /path/to/samples

# List variant clusters
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.variant_cli list

# Show cluster details
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.variant_cli show --cluster lockbit_variant_123

# Generate variant definitions
python -m threat_intel.family_detection.variant_cli generate
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Start monitoring system
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli start

# Show current status
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli status

# Process a sample
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli process /path/to/sample.json

# Monitor a directory for new samples
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli monitor /path/to/samples

# Run the REST API server
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli server

# Stop the monitoring system
python -m threat_intel.monitoring.monitoring_cli stop
```

### Relationship Visualization

```bash
# Generate relationship graph
python -m threat_intel.visualization.graph_cli generate --format html --open-browser

# List available families and variants
python -m threat_intel.visualization.graph_cli list --show-variants

python -m threat_intel.visualization.graph_cli similarities

# Analyze a specific variant
python -m threat_intel.visualization.graph_cli variant --variant-name lockbit_variant_20230101
```

## Integration with Existing System

The enhanced ransomware detection system integrates with the existing correlation engine:

```python
from threat_intel.correlation.correlation_engine_patch import EnhancedCorrelationEngine

# Create enhanced engine
engine = EnhancedCorrelationEngine(
    families_dir="/path/to/families",
    yara_rules_dir="/path/to/yara_rules"
)

# Correlate sample
result = engine.correlate_sample(sample_data)
```

## API Access

The system provides a REST API for integration with other systems:

```python
import requests

# Get detection status
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/status")
status = response.json()

# Submit a sample
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/api/sample", json=sample_data)
result = response.json()

# Get family details
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/family/lockbit")
family = response.json()

# Get variant clusters
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/variants?min_confidence=0.7")
variants = response.json()
```
