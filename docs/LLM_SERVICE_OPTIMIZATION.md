# LLM Service Cost Optimization

## Overview

The Innora-Defender LLM Service is a cost-optimized integration that leverages large language models for advanced ransomware analysis while minimizing operational costs. By prioritizing vLLM (self-hosted models) for most tasks and selectively using premium models only when necessary, the service achieves significant cost savings without compromising analysis quality.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Optimized Multi-Provider Architecture**: Supports multiple LLM providers (vLLM, OpenAI, Claude, Qianwen)
- **Feature-Based Routing**: Routes different types of tasks to the most appropriate and cost-effective model
- **Automatic Fallback Mechanism**: Seamlessly fails over to alternative providers if the primary provider is unavailable
- **Performance and Cost Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of API usage, costs, and performance metrics
- **Ransomware-Specific Prompting**: Specialized prompt templates designed for ransomware analysis tasks

## Cost Reduction Strategy

The LLM Service implements a sophisticated cost-reduction strategy:

1. **vLLM Prioritization**: Uses self-hosted open-source models for most tasks, which can be up to 60x less expensive than premium models
2. **Feature-Based Task Routing**: Routes tasks based on complexity to appropriate models
3. **Comprehensive Caching**: Avoids redundant API calls by caching analysis results
4. **Prompt Optimization**: Designs prompts to minimize token usage while maximizing result quality

### Cost Comparison

| Provider | Cost per 1K Tokens | Relative Cost |
|----------|-------------------:|-------------:|
| vLLM | $0.0005 | 1x |
| Qianwen Fast | $0.005 | 10x |
| Qianwen Detail | $0.015 | 30x |
| OpenAI GPT-4o | $0.015 | 30x |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | $0.03 | 60x |

By routing 80-90% of tasks to vLLM, the service reduces costs by up to 80-95% compared to using premium models exclusively.

## Implementation

The LLM Service is implemented as a modular Python package in the `ai_detection/llm_service` directory, featuring:

1. **LLM Provider Manager**: Handles provider selection, API calls, fallbacks, and monitoring
2. **Ransomware Analyzer**: Specialized interface for ransomware sample analysis
3. **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration through files and environment variables
4. **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for direct interaction with the service

## Usage Example

```python
from ai_detection.llm_service import RansomwareAnalyzer

# Create analyzer
analyzer = RansomwareAnalyzer()

# Run analysis on ransomware sample
result = analyzer.analyze(
    sample_path="/path/to/ransomware.exe",
    upstream_results={
        "family": "LockBit",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "key_features": ["File encryption capability", "Registry modifications"]
    }
)

# Print results
print(f"LLM-detected family: {result['llm_family']}")
print(f"LLM-detected variant: {result['llm_variant']}")

# Get potential weaknesses identified by LLM
for weakness in result.get("potential_weaknesses", []):
    print(f"Potential weakness: {weakness}")
```

## Command-Line Interface

The LLM Service includes a comprehensive CLI tool:

```bash
# Analyze a ransomware sample
python -m ai_detection.llm_service.cli analyze --sample /path/to/sample.exe

# Batch analyze multiple samples
python -m ai_detection.llm_service.cli batch --input batch.json --output results.json

# Interactive chat with LLM
python -m ai_detection.llm_service.cli chat --feature F4

# View cost report
python -m ai_detection.llm_service.cli costs
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The LLM Service integrates seamlessly with Innora-Defender's existing AI-based detection systems:

1. **Two-Stage Detection**: Enhances first-stage ML models with deeper LLM analysis
2. **Feature Extraction Support**: Leverages existing feature extractors to provide context for LLM analysis
3. **Enhanced Classification**: Improves family and variant identification accuracy

## Conclusion

The Innora-Defender LLM Service represents a significant advancement in cost-efficient AI integration for cybersecurity applications. By intelligently routing tasks between different LLM providers based on task requirements, the service delivers premium-quality analysis while drastically reducing operational costs.

The system demonstrates how targeted use of self-hosted open-source models can achieve substantial cost savings without sacrificing analytical capabilities, providing a blueprint for cost-effective AI integration in cybersecurity tools.
