## Component Details

### 1. NetworkKeyExtractor

The `NetworkKeyExtractor` is responsible for identifying and extracting potential encryption keys from network traffic.

#### Key Identification Methods

| Method | Description | Confidence Level |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pattern Matching | Regular expressions to identify key-like patterns | Medium |
| Entropy Analysis | Statistical analysis of data randomness | High for high-entropy blocks |
| C2 Traffic Analysis | Extraction from known C2 communication patterns | High |
| DNS Tunneling Analysis | Decoding of data hidden in DNS queries | Medium |
| File Markers | Identification of known key storage structures | Very High |

#### Entropy Thresholds

| Data Type | Entropy Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| < 4.0 | Low entropy | Unlikely to be encryption-related |
| 4.0 - 6.0 | Medium entropy | Potential IVs, nonces, or encoded data |
| 6.0 - 7.0 | High entropy | Likely encryption keys or encrypted data |
| > 7.0 | Very high entropy | Almost certainly encrypted or random data |

#### Key Format Detection

The system can detect and process keys in multiple formats:

- **Raw binary** - Direct byte values
- **Base64 encoded** - Textual representation using base64 alphabet
- **Hex encoded** - Textual representation using hexadecimal
- **PEM encoded** - For RSA and other asymmetric keys

#### Implementation Notes

```python
# Entropy calculation is critical for key identification
def _calculate_entropy(self, data: bytes) -> float:
    """Calculate Shannon entropy of data"""
    if not data:
        return 0
        
    # Calculate byte frequency
    counter = {}
    for byte in data:
        if byte not in counter:
            counter[byte] = 0
        counter[byte] += 1
    
    # Calculate entropy
    entropy = 0
    for count in counter.values():
        probability = count / len(data)
        entropy -= probability * (math.log(probability) / math.log(2))
    
    return entropy
```

### 2. RansomwareNetworkDetector

The `RansomwareNetworkDetector` analyzes network traffic for patterns associated with ransomware communication.

#### Detection Capabilities

| Feature | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| C2 Domain Detection | Matches domains against known C2 patterns | Regex and exact matching |
| Traffic Pattern Analysis | Identifies characteristic traffic sequences | Pattern matching with context |
| Protocol Analysis | Detects misuse of standard protocols | Protocol parsing and anomaly detection |
| JA3 Fingerprinting | TLS client fingerprinting for malware detection | Hash comparison |
| Data Exfiltration Detection | Identifies suspicious outbound data transfer | Volume and entropy analysis |

#### Alert Types

| Alert Type | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `c2_communication` | Direct communication with known C2 infrastructure | High |
| `c2_domain_query` | DNS lookup for known C2 domain | Medium |
| `suspicious_tls_fingerprint` | TLS fingerprint matching known ransomware | Medium |
| `suspicious_port` | Connection to port commonly used by ransomware | Low |
| `potential_encryption_key` | Possible encryption key in network traffic | High |
| `data_exfiltration` | Possible data theft before encryption | High |

#### Network Capture Methods

The detector supports multiple packet capture methods:

1. **PyShark** - Python wrapper for Wireshark's tshark
2. **Scapy** - Pure Python packet manipulation library
3. **DPKT** - Fast, simple packet creation/parsing
4. **Basic Socket** - Fallback using raw sockets when other libraries unavailable

### 3. NetworkBasedRecovery

The `NetworkBasedRecovery` component uses extracted keys to attempt decryption of ransomware-encrypted files.

#### Supported Encryption Algorithms

| Algorithm | Modes | Key Sizes | Implementation Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| AES | CBC, ECB, CTR | 128, 192, 256 bit | Complete |
| ChaCha20 | Stream | 256 bit | Complete |
| Salsa20 | Stream | 256 bit | Partial (placeholder) |
| RSA | N/A | Variable | Detection only |

#### Decryption Process

1. **Structure Detection**: Analyze encrypted file to determine structure
2. **Key Selection**: Select appropriate keys based on file analysis
3. **Algorithm Detection**: Determine which encryption algorithm was used
4. **Decryption Attempts**: Try various combinations of keys, algorithms, and modes
5. **Result Validation**: Verify if decryption was successful using various heuristics

#### Decryption Validation Methods

| Method | Description | Reliability |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| File Signature | Check for known file headers | Very High |
| Entropy Analysis | Decrypted data should have lower entropy | High |
| Printable Characters | Check ratio of printable characters for text files | Medium |
| Original File Comparison | Compare with original file if available | Very High |
| Binary Structure | Check for expected binary file patterns | Medium |

#### Implementation Notes

The decryption component uses the `cryptography` library for most encryption operations:

```python
def _decrypt_aes_cbc(self, data: bytes, key: bytes, iv: Optional[bytes] = None, 
                    iv_in_file: bool = False) -> Optional[bytes]:
    """
    Decrypt data using AES in CBC mode
    """
    # Implementation using the cryptography library
    algorithm = algorithms.AES(key)
    cipher = Cipher(algorithm, modes.CBC(iv))
    decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
    
    # Decrypt
    decrypted = decryptor.update(data) + decryptor.finalize()
    
    # Handle padding
    # ...
```

### 4. RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer

The `RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer` integrates all components for comprehensive analysis.

3. **Key Extraction**: Extract potential encryption keys from network traffic
4. **Sample Analysis**: Analyze encrypted files to identify ransomware families
5. **Decryption Attempts**: Use extracted keys to attempt decryption
6. **Report Generation**: Create comprehensive analysis report

#### Report Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-02T14:30:22.123456",
  "identified_ransomware_families": ["LockBit", "BlackCat"],
  "extracted_keys": {
    "network": [
      {
        "key_id": "aes-256-a1b2c3d4-20250502143022",
        "key_type": "aes-256",
        "key_data_hex": "a1b2c3d4...",
        "confidence": 0.85
      }
    ],
    "memory": []
  },
  "results": {
    "pcap_analysis": { /* PCAP analysis details */ },
    "sample_analysis": { /* Sample analysis details */ },
    "memory_analysis": { /* Memory analysis details */ }
  },
  "summary": {
    "ransomware_detected": true,
    "family_count": 2,
    "network_key_count": 3,
    "memory_key_count": 0
  }
}
```

## Ransomware Family Network Patterns

The system includes a comprehensive database of network patterns for major ransomware families. Each family profile includes:

### Pattern Types

1. **C2 Domains and IPs**: Known command and control infrastructure
2. **Port Patterns**: Common ports used for C2 and lateral movement
3. **Traffic Patterns**: Characteristic network traffic sequences
4. **Exfiltration Indicators**: Patterns associated with data theft
5. **Detection Signatures**: Snort, Suricata, and Zeek rules

### Example Pattern for LockBit Ransomware

```json
"port_patterns": [
    {"port": 443, "protocol": "tcp", "purpose": "HTTPS communication with C2"},
    {"port": 445, "protocol": "tcp", "purpose": "SMB for lateral movement"},
    {"port": 135, "protocol": "tcp", "purpose": "RPC for discovery and lateral movement"}
],
"traffic_patterns": [
    {"pattern": "HTTPS traffic with distinctive cipher preferences", "confidence": "medium"},
    {"pattern": "SMB traffic with specific command sequences for lateral movement", "confidence": "high"},
    {"pattern": "Unusual volume of internal scanning and connections to domain controllers", "confidence": "high"},
    {"pattern": "Abnormal RPC and LDAP queries for domain enumeration", "confidence": "high"}
]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

| Component | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Network Usage |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| NetworkKeyExtractor | High during PCAP processing | Moderate (scales with PCAP size) | None |
| RansomwareNetworkDetector | Moderate to High | Moderate (scales with traffic volume) | Low (for alert reporting) |
| NetworkBasedRecovery | Very High during decryption | Moderate | None |
| RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer | Depends on enabled components | Moderate | Low |

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files/packets in batches
2. **Concurrent Execution**: Use multi-threading for parallel analysis
3. **Early Filtering**: Apply initial filters to reduce data volume
4. **Incremental Processing**: Process PCAP files in chunks
5. **Cache Usage**: Cache extracted keys and analysis results

## Error Handling and Logging

The system implements comprehensive error handling and logging:

1. **Logging Levels**:
   - DEBUG: Detailed debugging information
   - INFO: General operational information
   - WARNING: Potential issues that don't prevent operation
   - ERROR: Errors that prevent specific operations
   - CRITICAL: Critical errors that may prevent system operation

2. **Error Recovery Strategies**:
   - Component isolation (failure in one component doesn't affect others)
   - Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing
   - Exception handling with meaningful error messages
   - Automatic retry for transient errors

## Security Considerations

1. **Handling of Sensitive Data**:
   - Encryption keys are kept in memory only
   - Keys written to disk are in secure formats
   - Reports can be configured to exclude sensitive data

2. **Privilege Requirements**:
   - Network monitoring requires elevated privileges
   - File operations use least privilege principle
   - Memory analysis might require administrative access

3. **Isolation**:
   - Analysis should be performed in isolated environments
   - Network traffic capture should be on isolated networks
   - Infected samples should be handled in secure sandboxes

## Integration with Existing Systems

The network-based recovery components integrate with:

1. **Existing Ransomware Analysis**:
   - Uses common data structures and file formats
   - Complements file-based detection with network perspective
   - Enhances recovery options with network-extracted keys

2. **Memory Forensics**:
   - Correlates network activity with memory artifacts
   - Combines keys from network and memory for better recovery
   - Provides context for memory analysis

3. **Threat Intelligence**:
   - Leverages existing ransomware family database
   - Enhances threat intelligence with network indicators
   - Contributes new indicators to threat intelligence database

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Retroactive Analysis

After a ransomware attack, network traffic captures (PCAPs) are available from security devices. The analyst wants to identify the ransomware family and attempt recovery.

```python
# Initialize analyzer with PCAP file
analyzer = RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer("incident_traffic.pcap")

# Analyze network traffic
analyzer.analyze_pcap()

# Analyze encrypted samples
analyzer.analyze_samples("/encrypted_files")

# Generate and save comprehensive report
report = analyzer.generate_report()
with open("ransomware_analysis_report.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)
```

### Scenario 2: Live Monitoring

Security team wants to monitor network traffic for signs of ransomware activity.

```python
# Initialize analyzer for live monitoring
analyzer = RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer(interface="eth0")

# Start monitoring for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
results = analyzer.monitor_network(3600)

# Check for detected ransomware
if results.get("identified_families"):
    print(f"ALERT: Ransomware detected: {results['identified_families']}")
    
    # Take automated actions
    # ...
```

### Scenario 3: Targeted Decryption

Security team has specific encrypted files and wants to attempt recovery using network-extracted keys.

```python
# Initialize key extractor
extractor = NetworkKeyExtractor("incident_traffic.pcap")

# Extract keys
keys = extractor.extract_potential_keys()
print(f"Extracted {len(keys)} potential keys")

# Initialize recovery with extracted keys
recovery = NetworkBasedRecovery(keys)

# Attempt decryption of specific file
results = recovery.attempt_decryption(
    "important_document.encrypted", 
    output_file="recovered_document.txt"
)

# Check results
for result in results:
    if result.success:
        print(f"Successfully decrypted using {result.key_used.key_type} key")
        break
else:
    print("Decryption failed with all available keys")
```
