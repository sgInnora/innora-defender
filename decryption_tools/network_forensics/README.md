# Network-Based Ransomware Recovery

This module provides specialized capabilities for identifying, analyzing, and recovering from ransomware attacks using network forensics. It integrates with our existing ransomware analysis tools to provide a more comprehensive solution.

## Overview

The Network-Based Ransomware Recovery module enhances ransomware analysis with the following key capabilities:

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Detects ransomware Command & Control (C2) communications by analyzing network traffic
2. **Encryption Key Extraction**: Identifies and extracts potential encryption keys from network traffic
3. **Network Pattern Recognition**: Matches traffic patterns against known ransomware communication profiles
4. **Memory Correlation**: Correlates network activity with memory forensics for enhanced key recovery
5. **Integrated Recovery**: Uses extracted keys to attempt decryption of ransomware-encrypted files

## Components

### 1. Network-Based Recovery (`network_based_recovery.py`)

This core component provides functionality for extracting encryption keys from network traffic and using them to decrypt ransomware-encrypted files:

- **NetworkKeyExtractor**: Analyzes PCAP files to extract potential encryption keys
- **ExtractedKey**: Data class for representing keys extracted from network traffic
- **NetworkBasedRecovery**: Uses extracted keys to attempt file decryption with multiple algorithms

Supported encryption algorithms:
- AES (CBC, ECB, CTR modes)
- ChaCha20
- Salsa20 (partial support)
- RSA key identification

### 2. Ransomware Network Detector (`ransomware_network_detector.py`)

Located in the `behavior_analysis/detectors` directory, this component detects ransomware-specific network patterns:

- Identifies command & control traffic for major ransomware families
- Detects data exfiltration patterns characteristic of double/triple extortion
- Monitors for encryption key exchange over the network
- Provides real-time alerts for suspicious traffic

### 3. Ransomware Network Analyzer (`ransomware_network_analyzer.py`)

This integration component brings together network analysis, file analysis, and decryption capabilities:

- Coordinates analysis of PCAP files, encrypted samples, and memory dumps
- Correlates network indicators with file encryption characteristics
- Attempts decryption using keys extracted from multiple sources
- Generates comprehensive reports of findings

## Usage

### Basic Key Extraction from PCAP

```python
from network_based_recovery import NetworkKeyExtractor

# Initialize the extractor with a PCAP file
extractor = NetworkKeyExtractor("network_capture.pcap")

# Extract potential encryption keys
keys = extractor.extract_potential_keys()

# Save keys to a file for later use
extractor.save_keys_to_file(keys, "extracted_keys.json")

print(f"Extracted {len(keys)} potential encryption keys")
```

### Decryption Using Extracted Keys

```python
from network_based_recovery import NetworkBasedRecovery

# Initialize the recovery module
recovery = NetworkBasedRecovery()

# Load keys from a file
recovery.load_keys_from_file("extracted_keys.json")

# Attempt to decrypt a file
results = recovery.attempt_decryption(
    "encrypted_file.txt", 
    output_file="decrypted_file.txt",
    original_file="original_file.txt"  # Optional, for validation
)

# Check results
for result in results:
    if result.success:
        print(f"Successfully decrypted file using {result.key_used.key_type} key")
    else:
        print(f"Decryption failed: {result.error}")
```

### Comprehensive Ransomware Analysis

```python
from ransomware_network_analyzer import RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer with a PCAP file
analyzer = RansomwareNetworkAnalyzer("network_capture.pcap")

# Analyze PCAP file
pcap_results = analyzer.analyze_pcap()

# Analyze encrypted samples
sample_results = analyzer.analyze_samples("samples_directory")

# Analyze memory dumps
memory_results = analyzer.analyze_memory_dumps("memory_dumps_directory")

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analyzer.generate_report()

# Save report to file
import json
with open("ransomware_analysis_report.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)
```

### Command-Line Usage

The `ransomware_network_analyzer.py` script can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
# Analyze a PCAP file
python ransomware_network_analyzer.py --pcap network_capture.pcap --report report.json

# Analyze PCAP and sample files, saving results to output directory
python ransomware_network_analyzer.py --pcap network_capture.pcap --samples ./samples --output ./output

# Monitor network for ransomware activity
python ransomware_network_analyzer.py --interface eth0 --monitor 300 --report report.json
```

## Ransomware Family Coverage

The module includes network traffic patterns and detection signatures for the following ransomware families:

1. **WannaCry**: Detection of SMB exploitation and kill-switch domain queries
2. **REvil/Sodinokibi**: Identification of C2 communication patterns and Salsa20 key exchange
3. **LockBit**: Detection of lateral movement and data exfiltration patterns
4. **BlackCat/ALPHV**: Recognition of Rust-based TLS fingerprints and triple extortion patterns
5. **Conti**: Identification of TrickBot-related infrastructure and exfiltration techniques
6. **Hive**: Detection of ESXi-specific commands and ransom negotiation communication
7. **Ryuk**: Identification of initial access and lateral movement patterns
8. **STOP/Djvu**: Detection of key exchange with C2 infrastructure

## Integration with Memory Forensics

This module is designed to work seamlessly with memory forensics tools:

1. **Memory-Network Correlation**: Links network connections to processes in memory
2. **Key Extraction**: Identifies encryption keys in memory associated with ransomware network activity
3. **Pattern Matching**: Uses similar patterns for both network and memory analysis

## Dependencies

- **dpkt**: For parsing PCAP files
- **cryptography**: For decryption operations
- **scapy** or **pyshark** (optional): For enhanced packet analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Salsa20 Support**: Complete implementation of Salsa20 decryption
2. **Memory Integration**: Deeper integration with memory forensics tools
3. **AI-Based Detection**: Machine learning models for identifying unknown ransomware variants
4. **More Ransomware Families**: Expanded coverage of emerging ransomware threats
