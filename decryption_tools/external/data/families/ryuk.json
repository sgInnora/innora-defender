  "description": "Ryuk is a sophisticated ransomware operation targeting large organizations and enterprises with high-value targets. It's known for its targeted approach and high ransom demands, often in the millions of dollars.",
  "encryption": {
    "algorithms": ["RSA-4096", "AES-256"],
    "implementation": "Ryuk uses a hybrid encryption approach. Files are encrypted with AES-256 using unique keys per file, and the AES keys are then encrypted with a RSA-4096 public key. The ransomware attempts to terminate processes and services that might lock files, and specifically targets databases, backups, and system files.",
