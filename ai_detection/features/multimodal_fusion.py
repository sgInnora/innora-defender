Multimodal Fusion Module for Ransomware Analysis

This module implements fusion techniques to combine features from different modalities
(static, dynamic, network) for improved ransomware detection. It provides various
fusion strategies including early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid approaches with
attention mechanisms.

Key features:
- Multiple fusion strategies (early, late, hybrid)
- Attention mechanisms for feature weighting
- Cross-modal relationship modeling
- Support for heterogeneous feature types
- Adaptive weight adjustment
