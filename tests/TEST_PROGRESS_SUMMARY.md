### Challenges Overcome

1. **Cryptographic Testing**
   - Cryptographic operations are difficult to test without actual keys
   - Solution: Implemented mock cryptography modules and stub implementations

2. **File System Operations**
   - Tests needed to avoid actual file system changes
   - Solution: Used temporary directories and mock file operations

3. **Complex Code Paths**
   - Many conditional branches made full coverage difficult
   - Solution: Created targeted tests for specific code paths

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Error paths were challenging to trigger in tests
   - Solution: Used mock objects that raise specific exceptions

5. **Integration Complexity**
   - Module has dependencies on multiple external components
   - Solution: Created comprehensive mock ecosystem for isolated testing

### Remaining Work

While significant progress has been made, some areas still need attention to reach the 95% target:

1. **Advanced Cryptographic Paths**
   - Certain complex cryptographic operations remain untested
   - Plan: Create more specialized stub implementations

2. **Memory Optimization Code**
   - Memory management code is difficult to test systematically
   - Plan: Develop memory usage simulation tests

3. **Rare Error Conditions**
   - Some error paths occur only in very specific circumstances
   - Plan: Create more targeted exception tests

4. **Optimization Logic**
   - Performance optimization code is challenging to test functionally
   - Plan: Add benchmarking-style tests

### Lessons Learned

1. **Design for Testability**
   - Future modules should be designed with testing in mind
   - Include test mode flags and dependency injection

2. **Modular Testing Approach**
   - Breaking tests into multiple files improved organization
   - Allowed focused testing on specific functionality

3. **Mock Framework Value**
   - Extensive use of mocks enabled testing of complex dependencies
   - Created controlled test environments for predictable results

4. **Incremental Improvement**
   - Step-by-step approach to coverage was more effective than trying to fix everything at once
   - Allowed for measurable progress and better focus

5. **Documentation Value**
   - Documenting test strategies improved team understanding
   - Created templates for testing other components

### Next Steps

1. Create additional targeted tests for remaining uncovered areas
2. Refactor some components to improve testability
3. Apply similar testing strategies to other critical modules
4. Implement test coverage measurement in CI/CD pipeline
5. Update documentation with latest test coverage metrics
