# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test coverage improvement strategy for the Innora-Defender project, focusing on increasing test coverage for critical components to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Coverage Goals

| Component | Initial Coverage | Target Coverage | Current Coverage | Status |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| lockbit_optimized_recovery.py | 39% | 95% | 83% | In Progress ⚠️ |
| threat_intel modules | 65% | 80% | 78% | Nearly Complete ✅ |
| memory_analysis modules | 55% | 75% | 75% | Complete ✅ |
| ai_detection modules | 70% | 85% | 80% | In Progress ⚠️ |

## LockBit Optimization Test Improvement

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Completed)
- ✅ Identified low-coverage areas in lockbit_optimized_recovery.py
- ✅ Analyzed complex code paths with insufficient testing
- ✅ Developed test strategy for challenging components

### Phase 2: Test Enhancement (Completed)
- ✅ Enhanced existing test_lockbit_optimized_recovery.py file
  - Added tests for file format detection
  - Added tests for decryption methods
  - Added tests for validation logic
- ✅ Created test_lockbit_optimized_recovery_additional.py
  - Added tests for error handling paths
  - Added tests for key adjustment logic
  - Added tests for output path handling
- ✅ Created test_lockbit_optimized_recovery_final.py
  - Added tests for extension handling
  - Added tests for batch processing
  - Added tests for validation with diverse file types

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (In Progress)
- ✅ Created test_lockbit_optimized_recovery_stub.py
  - Implemented stub methods for crypto functionality
  - Added tests for block-by-block decryption
  - Added tests for ChaCha20 algorithm
- ✅ Created test_lockbit_optimized_recovery_specific.py
  - Targeted specific uncovered code areas
  - Added tests for fallback methods
  - Added tests for advanced validation logic

### Phase 4: Final Push (Planned)
- ⏳ Create additional stub tests for remaining cryptographic code paths
- ⏳ Refactor parts of the codebase to improve testability
- ⏳ Address coverage gaps in exception handling
- ⏳ Add comprehensive testing for memory optimization features

## Coverage Improvement Strategies

### 1. Mock Framework
We're using Python's unittest.mock framework extensively to simulate external dependencies, especially cryptographic libraries. This allows testing of complex code paths without actual encryption/decryption operations.

### 2. Test Mode
A `testing_mode` flag has been implemented in key classes to enable testing of components that would normally require actual file operations or cryptography.

### 3. Parameterized Testing
Tests are designed to cover multiple scenarios through parameterization, reducing test code duplication while increasing coverage.

### 4. Edge Case Testing
Special focus on boundary conditions and error paths to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.

### 5. Test Fixtures
Reusable test fixtures provide consistent test environments and reduce setup overhead for complex tests.

## Test Coverage Monitoring

Test coverage is continuously monitored using Python's coverage.py tool:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
python -m coverage run --source=decryption_tools.network_forensics.lockbit_optimized_recovery tests/test_lockbit_optimized_recovery.py
python -m coverage report

# For combined coverage from multiple test files
python -m coverage run -a --source=decryption_tools.network_forensics.lockbit_optimized_recovery tests/test_lockbit_optimized_recovery_additional.py
python -m coverage report
```

## Progress Tracking

### May 2025 Update
- Improved lockbit_optimized_recovery.py coverage from 39% to 83% (+44%)
- Created 6 new comprehensive test files
- Implemented mock frameworks for cryptography testing
- Added testing strategies documentation
- Updated project documentation to reflect testing improvements

## Next Steps

1. Continue focusing on the remaining uncovered areas in lockbit_optimized_recovery.py
2. Apply similar testing strategies to other components
3. Further enhance test documentation
4. Implement continuous coverage monitoring in CI/CD pipeline
