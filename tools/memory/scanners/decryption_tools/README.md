# Ransomware Recovery Toolkit

This toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources for analyzing ransomware infections, identifying ransomware families, and attempting recovery of encrypted files.

## Overview

The Ransomware Recovery Toolkit integrates publicly available ransomware decryption tools and resources into a unified framework. It provides the following capabilities:

- **Ransomware Family Detection**: Analyzes encrypted files to identify the specific ransomware family
- **Encryption Analysis**: Determines encryption algorithms, modes, and potential weaknesses
- **Decryption Tool Integration**: Manages and applies appropriate decryption tools based on detected ransomware
- **Memory Forensics**: Guides memory analysis techniques for potential key recovery
- **Recovery Strategies**: Provides ransomware-specific recovery approaches

## Components

### Tool Registry

Manages a catalog of publicly available ransomware decryption tools:
- Tracks tool metadata, versions, and compatibility
- Handles automatic downloading and updating
- Enforces integrity verification of downloaded tools

### Tool Wrapper

Provides a unified interface to diverse decryption tools:
- Standardizes command-line parameters
- Handles platform-specific execution requirements
- Manages tool dependencies and prerequisites

### Encryption Analyzer

Analyzes encrypted files to identify ransomware families:
- Performs entropy analysis to detect encryption characteristics
- Identifies file markers, extensions, and ransom notes
- Detects encryption algorithms and modes
- Maps findings to known ransomware families

### Recovery Interface

Integrates all components into a unified command-line tool:
- Guides users through the recovery process
- Manages application of appropriate tools
- Provides detailed reporting on analysis and recovery attempts

## Ransomware Family Database

Our comprehensive ransomware family database currently contains detailed profiles for the following ransomware families:

1. **WannaCry** - Global ransomware that used EternalBlue exploit to spread rapidly across networks
2. **STOP/Djvu** - High-volume ransomware targeting home users through cracked software
3. **Ryuk** - Sophisticated targeted ransomware focusing on large enterprises
4. **REvil/Sodinokibi** - Advanced RaaS operation behind major supply chain attacks
5. **LockBit** - Highly active ransomware with sophisticated features and self-spreading capabilities
6. **BlackCat/ALPHV** - Modern Rust-based ransomware with cross-platform capabilities
7. **Conti** - Aggressive operation that targeted critical infrastructure worldwide
8. **Hive** - Ransomware targeting healthcare and critical infrastructure, disrupted by law enforcement

Each profile contains:
- Technical details of encryption methods
- File markers and indicators
- Available decryption options
- Memory forensics guidance
- Recovery strategies
- Detection signatures

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```
python ransomware_recovery.py analyze --file /path/to/encrypted/file
```

### Family Detection

```
python ransomware_recovery.py identify --file /path/to/encrypted/file
```

### Decryption Attempt

```
python ransomware_recovery.py decrypt --file /path/to/encrypted/file --original /path/to/original/file
```

### Tool Management

```
python ransomware_recovery.py tools list
python ransomware_recovery.py tools update
python ransomware_recovery.py tools download --family wannacry
```

### Family Information

```
python ransomware_recovery.py family-info wannacry
```

## Memory Forensics Integration

The toolkit provides guidance for memory forensics techniques that may assist in key recovery:

1. **Live Memory Acquisition**: Guidance on capturing memory during active encryption
2. **Key Extraction**: Techniques for locating encryption keys in memory dumps
3. **Integration with Analysis Tools**: Using Volatility, Rekall, and other memory forensics frameworks
4. **Ransomware-Specific Patterns**: Memory signatures for specific ransomware families

## Disclaimer

This toolkit does not guarantee successful recovery of encrypted files. Ransomware recovery depends on many factors including:
- The specific ransomware variant
- Whether implementation flaws exist
- Availability of decryption keys
- Quality of available memory forensics data

The most reliable protection against ransomware remains regular, secure backups stored offline or in isolated environments.
